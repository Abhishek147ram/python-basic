What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n"," -  Function: A standalone block of code that performs a task. Called like function_name().\n"," -  Method: A function that belongs to an object or class. Called like object.method_name().\n","2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n"," - Parameters are the variable names in the function definition.\n"," - Arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it's called.\n","3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n"," - In Python, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.\n","You can define and call functions in several ways:\n","    - Standerd Function\n","    - Function with Parameter\n","    - Function with Default Parameter\n","    - Lambda function\n","    - Keywords Arguments\n","    - Calling lambda\n","4. What is the purpose of the return statement in a Python function?\n"," -  The purpose of the return statement in a Python function:\n","     - Ends the function execution.\n","     - Passes data back to where the function was called.\n","     - Allows the result to be stored or used elsewhere.\n","5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n"," - Iterators in Python are objects that allow you to traverse through a sequence one item at a time.\n","     - Iterable: An object you can loop over (e.g., list, tuple). It has an __iter__() method.\n","     - Iterator: An object that produces items one at a time using __next__(). It has both __iter__() and __next__().\n","6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n"," - Generators are special functions that yield values one at a time.\n"," - They don’t store the entire sequence in memory—great for large data!\n"," - They automatically create an iterator.\n","7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n"," - Generators yield one item at a time, so they don’t store the entire result in memory.\n"," - Values are produced only when needed, which speeds up performance in some cases.\n"," - Automatically remembers where it left off between yield calls.\n"," - Easier to write than manually creating iterator classes.\n","8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n"," - A lambda function is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword.\n"," - It can take any number of arguments but has only one expression.\n","9. Explain the purpose and usage of the map() function in Python.\n"," - The map() function applies a given function to each item in an iterable (like a list or tuple).\n"," - It returns a map object, which is an iterator.\n","10. What is the difference between map(), reduce(), and filter() functions in Python?\n"," - map(): Applies a function to each item in an iterable.\n"," Example: map(lambda x: x*2, [1, 2, 3]) - [2, 4, 6]\n"," - filter(): Filters items based on a condition.\n"," Example: filter(lambda x: x%2==0, [1, 2, 3]) - [2]\n"," - reduce(): Applies a function cumulatively to reduce the iterable to a single value.\n"," Example: reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, [1, 2, 3]) - 6\n","11.
