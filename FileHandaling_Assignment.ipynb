        "2 What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        " - Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to detect and respond to errors (exceptions) at runtime without stopping the entire program.\n",
        "\n",
        "3 What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "- The finally block in Python is used to define a section of code that will always execute, regardless of whether an exception occurs in the try block or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "4 What is logging in Python?\n",
        " - Logging in Python is the process of recording events that occur during a program's execution. It helps developers track what the program is doing, debug errors, and keep a record of runtime information.\n",
        "\n",
        "5 What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " - The __del__ method is a destructor method in Python, called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., when it goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted).\n",

        "\n",
        " - Cyclic Garbage Collector\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Handles situations where objects reference each other (reference cycles), which reference counting alone cannot resolve.\n",
