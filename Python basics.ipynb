What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","  - Python is a programming language with certain set of instruction which help us to connect with computer easily .\n","  - Python  is popular because its easy to learn and python has more than 13700 liberies that makes python special and make owr work easer.\n","\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","   - An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes your Python code. It translates your code into a language that the computer's processor can understand and execute.\n","\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python    \n","   - Python predefine keywords are reserved words that have special meaning in the language , they are like grammer of python . you cant used them as veriable , function and identifier.\n","\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","   - No keywords cannot used as veriable name they are used for special purpous and functions in the language.\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python?\n","   - Python handle imtability at the object level and this plays a big role .\n","   - A mutable object can be change after its create.\n","\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","   - List  are mutable because you can change, add or remove elements, like [1,2,3]\n","   - Tuple are immutable because its can create once, like(1,2,3)\n","\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","   -The \"==\" operator compares the values of two objects and \"is\" operator checks if two variables point to the same object or not in memory.\n","\n","8.  What are logical operators in Python?\n","    - Logical operators in Python are combine conditional statements and their are three logical operators are and, or, and not.\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python?\n","   - Type casting is python is the process of converting a veriable form of one data type to another data type, like\n","   Implicit type casting,\n","   explicit type casting\n","\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","    - In implicit type casting python automatically convert one data type to anotherduring an operation\n","    - In explicit type casting you manually convert data type using function like, int() ,float(), str()\n","\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","    - The purpous of conditional statement in python is allows for decision-making and control flow within the program and the most common conditional statements are if, elif (else if), and else.\n","\n","12. How does the elif statement work?\n","    - The elif statement is used in conditional statements to check for additional conditions if the previous if or elif statements were false. The elif statement will only checked if the preceding if or elif conditions are not.\n","\n","13.  What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","    - For loop is used when you are working with structural data like CSV row or dictionary keys.\n","    - While loop is using when you're building interactive program or handeling user input where the end condition is not fixed.\n","\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n","    - A while loop is more suitable than a for loop when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true, but you don't know in advance how many times the loop will need to run."],"metadata":{"id":"p6vZqzIvjBEx"}}]}
